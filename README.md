# DQL Queries

### 1. Self Join

```sql
SELECT e1.last_name || ' works for ' || e2.last_name "employees and Their Managers",
       e1.*, e2.last_name
FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2
    ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id
   AND e1.last_name LIKE 'R%'
ORDER BY e1.last_name;
```

### 2. Left Outer Join

```sql
SELECT d.department_id, e.last_name
FROM departments d
LEFT OUTER JOIN employees e
    ON d.department_id = e.department_id
ORDER BY d.department_id, e.last_name;
```

### 3. Right Outer Join

```sql
SELECT d.department_id, e.last_name
FROM departments d
RIGHT OUTER JOIN employees e
    ON d.department_id = e.department_id
ORDER BY d.department_id, e.last_name;
```

```sql
DELETE FROM departments
WHERE department_id = 100;
```

### 4. Full Outer Join

```sql
SELECT d.department_id, e.last_name
FROM departments d
LEFT OUTER JOIN employees e
    ON d.department_id = e.department_id
UNION ALL
SELECT d.department_id, e.last_name
FROM departments d
RIGHT OUTER JOIN employees e
    ON d.department_id = e.department_id;
```

### 5. Sub Query Example

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department_id NOT IN (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM departments
    WHERE location_id = 1700
)
ORDER BY last_name;
```

### 6. Top 10 Salary Employees

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS rn
    FROM employees
) AS t1
WHERE rn < 11;
```

### 7. Ranking Functions

```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name, job_id, hire_date, salary,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) AS hire_seq_rank,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) AS hire_seq_RN,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) AS hire_seq_dense_rank
FROM employees;
```

### 8. View Example

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW emp_details_view AS
SELECT e.employee_id,
       e.job_id,
       e.manager_id,
       e.department_id,
       d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d
    ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

### 9. Sub Queries (Single Row)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hr.departments
WHERE department_name = (
    SELECT department_name
    FROM hr.departments
    WHERE department_name = 'IT'
);
```

### 10. Sub Queries (Multiple Rows)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hr.departments
WHERE department_name IN (
    SELECT department_name
    FROM hr.departments
    WHERE department_name = 'IT'
       OR department_name = 'Administration'
);
```

### 11. Sub Queries (Multiple Columns)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hr.departments
WHERE (department_id, department_name) IN (
    SELECT department_id, department_name
    FROM hr.departments
    WHERE department_name = 'IT'
       OR department_name = 'Administration'
);
```

### 12. Inline View

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, a.department_id, e.last_name, e.salary, a.min_sal
FROM hr.employees e,
     (SELECT MIN(salary) min_sal, department_id
      FROM hr.employees
      GROUP BY department_id) a
WHERE e.department_id = a.department_id
ORDER BY e.department_id, e.salary DESC;
```

### 13. Top-N Analysis

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.last_name, e.salary
    FROM hr.employees e
    ORDER BY e.salary DESC
)
WHERE ROWNUM < 6;
```

### 14. Analytical Queries

```sql
SELECT NAME, company, power,
       RANK() OVER(ORDER BY power DESC) AS RANK,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY power DESC) AS Row_Number
FROM cars1;
```

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT NAME, company, power,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY NAME, company ORDER BY power DESC) AS Row_Number
    FROM cars1
)
SELECT *
FROM cte
WHERE NAME = 'Prius' AND Row_Number = 1;
```

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT NAME, company, power,
           RANK() OVER(ORDER BY power DESC) AS RANK,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY power DESC) AS Row_Number
    FROM cars1
)
SELECT *
FROM cte;
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT NAME, company, power,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY power) AS dn
    FROM cars1
    ORDER BY company
)
WHERE company = 'Toyota';
